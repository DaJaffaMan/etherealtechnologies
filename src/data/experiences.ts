      'My journey at Superdry was a transformative experience. I helped lead the initiative to recreate the customer-facing monolith, moving away from PHP and into more flexible microservices. It was a dynamic project where I optimised and reduced operational costs by implementing lambdas and serverless architecture to handle API requests. I had a direct hand in parsing and storing customer products in the document-based database DynamoDB. This significantly improved customer experience by retaining customer sessions between visits and reducing page loading times through tools like ElastiCache and S3, along with configuring edge computing/CDN. I also dedicated time to simplifying data warehousing by migrating legacy scripts to a more maintainable execution in AWS, with the help of serverless and cloud functions.',
