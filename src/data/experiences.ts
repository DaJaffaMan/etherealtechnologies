    description:
      "When I joined Pynea, there was virtually no code in sight. However, that quickly changed in my short time consulting for this fast-paced startup. Personally, I felt a strong sense of responsibility when I took charge of dockerizing the backend GraphQL server. It was a thrilling challenge to create a pipeline infrastructure that ensured no regressions during the build, test, and deployment phases of our dockerized application. Additionally, I created the media management system for all customer data, which was stored and managed on AWS.",

    description:
      "My journey at Superdry was a transformative experience. I helped lead the initiative to recreate the customer-facing monolith, moving away from PHP and into more flexible microservices. It was a dynamic project where I optimized and reduced operational costs by implementing lambdas and serverless architecture to handle API requests. I had a direct hand in parsing and storing customer products in the document-based database DynamoDB. This significantly improved customer experience by retaining customer sessions between visits and reducing page loading times through tools like ElastiCache and S3, along with configuring edge computing/CDN. I also dedicated time to simplifying data warehousing by migrating legacy scripts to a more maintainable execution in AWS, with the help of serverless and cloud functions.",

This was a ground-up greenfield project that involved taking a dozen different funding systems used by councils across the UK and creating a fast, modern, GDS-compliant, scalable web platform. It was a challenging endeavor that required a high degree of flexibility in the application processing for funding opportunities. I was excited to use the latest technologies, including TypeScript, to make a significant impact and deliver results that exceeded expectations.",
